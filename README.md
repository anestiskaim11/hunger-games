# Hunger-games
A university assignment where we had to code the board game "hunger games" with graphics.

## Rules
* Two player game, both start from the bottom right corner of the table
* Players gather points from food and lose points from traps (ropes, wild animals)
* Players can gather weapons (bow, sword, pistol)
* If a player has picked up a bow they can disable wild animal traps
* If a player has picked up a bow they can disable rope traps
* if a player owns a pistol they can kill the other player if they are in a neighbour block
* The board shrinks every 3 rounds
* Game ends if the board reaches size 4x4 or if a player dies
